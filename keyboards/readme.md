# QMK Keyboards
QMK runs on a diverse range of keyboards. Some of these keyboards are officially supported and see constant community contributions, while others are part of the repository for historical reasons.

# This Configuration
This fork is meant only to support a specific set of viterbi keymappings, and has kept only a few ortholinear keymaps as references
